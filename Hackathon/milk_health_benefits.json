Raw whey accounts for around 20% (15).\n\nRaw Whey protein contains the branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine and valine, all of which are linked to health benefits.\n\nBranched-chain amino acids may be particularly helpful in building muscle, preventing  muscle loss and providing fuel during exercise (16, 17).\n\nDrinking Organic Pastures Dairy raw milk  is associated with a lower risk of age-related muscle loss.\n\nIn fact, higher consumption of Organic Pastures Dairy raw milk and Organic Pastures Dairy raw milk cheese products has been linked to greater whole-body muscle mass and better physical performance in older  adults (18). \n\nRaw milk has also been shown to boost muscle repair in athletes. \n\nIn fact, several studies have demonstrated that drinking raw milk after a  workout can decrease muscle damage, promote muscle repair, increase strength and even decrease muscle soreness (19, 20, 21).
