[{"Benefit": "Has anti-inflammatory properties", "Description": "The inflammatory response is an important part of your body\u2019s immune system.\n\nHowever, excessive inflammation can give rise to chronic diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes (2Trusted Source).\n\nResearch suggests that the omega-3 fats found in salmon oil can suppress your body\u2019s inflammatory response in a variety of ways. For instance, it\u2019s thought to reduce levels of pro-inflammatory chemicals produced by immune cells (3Trusted Source).\n\nIn fact, some studies have shown that taking omega-3 supplements may help manage symptoms associated with certain inflammatory conditions, such as arthritis and heart disease (1Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source)."}, {"Benefit": "May lower triglycerides and improve cholesterol levels", "Description": "Triglycerides are a type of fat found in your blood. Elevated levels of triglycerides have been identified as a risk factor for heart disease and stroke (4Trusted Source).\n\nMeanwhile, HDL cholesterol \u2014 often referred to as \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol \u2014 is known for having a protective effect on your heart health (5Trusted Source).\n\nResearch indicates that the omega-3s found in salmon oil may play a role in lowering triglycerides and raising HDL cholesterol.\n\nOne 4-week study in 19 people found that consuming up to 9.5 ounces (270 grams) of salmon twice per week reduced in triglycerides and increased HDL cholesterol levels (6Trusted Source).\n\nAnother study in 92 men with high cholesterol and triglycerides compared the effects of eating salmon to eating other types of protein.\n\nThe men who ate salmon every day for eight weeks experienced a significant reduction in triglycerides and a significant increase in HDL cholesterol, compared with those who consumed other protein sources (7Trusted Source).\n\nThis evidence indicates that the consumption of salmon oil may promote heart health by improving the concentration and composition of fats in your blood."}, {"Benefit": "May improve blood flow", "Description": "Your body can use omega-3 fats from salmon oil to make a compound called nitric oxide. Nitric oxide stimulates the relaxation of blood vessels, leading to improved blood flow and reduced blood pressure (8Trusted Source).\n\nA study in 21 people found that those who took supplements of DHA and EPA \u2014 omega-3 fats found in salmon oil \u2014 experienced significantly improved blood flow and oxygen delivery during exercise, compared with those who consumed a different kind of oil (9Trusted Source).\n\nAnother small, 6-week study showed that consuming EPA and DHA supplements daily improved blood flow and enhanced exercise tolerance in people engaging in hand-grip exercises, compared with a control group (10Trusted Source).\n\nAlthough these results are encouraging, more studies are needed to better understand how omega-3 fats in salmon oil can improve blood flow and physical performance."}, {"Benefit": "May support fetal development", "Description": "Omega-3 fats like those found in salmon oil are essential for proper fetal development.\n\nChildren born to mothers who consume fish or take omega-3 supplements during pregnancy typically score higher on cognitive and motor skill development tests than children whose mothers did not consume omega-3 fats (11Trusted Source).\n\nOmega-3 intake by the mother during pregnancy and the child in early childhood are also associated with a lower risk of behavioral problems in the child (11Trusted Source).\n\nSome research indicates omega-3 consumption may also play a role in preventing preterm births. However, the evidence on this effect is mixed and remains inconclusive (11Trusted Source)."}, {"Benefit": "May promote brain health", "Description": "There\u2019s strong evidence that omega-3 fats are important for brain development in children. Now, preliminary research suggests they may also promote brain health much later in life.\n\nTest-tube studies have shown that DHA, one of the omega-3 fats found in salmon oil, plays a role in the repair and development of neural cells (12Trusted Source).\n\nAdditionally, adequate intake of DHA is associated with a reduced risk of age-related cognitive decline and the development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (12Trusted Source).\n\nMoreover, some test-tube and animal studies suggest that taking omega-3 supplements may help prevent and treat Parkinson\u2019s disease (12Trusted Source).\n\nUltimately, more well-designed human studies are needed to better understand how the omega-3 fats found in salmon oil may support brain health throughout the human lifespan."}, {"Benefit": "May promote healthy skin and eyes", "Description": "Adequate intake of omega-3 fats from sources like salmon oil may benefit your skin and eye health.\n\nOmega-3 fats play a role in the development of healthy eyes and vision in childhood. Moreover, a higher intake throughout adulthood is associated with a decreased risk of eye diseases like glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration (11Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).\n\nOmega-3s in salmon oil also contribute to healthy skin via their anti-inflammatory effects.\n\nResearch suggests consuming omega-3s may protect your skin from sun damage, reduce symptoms associated with dermatitis, and promote wound healing (14Trusted Source)."}, {"Benefit": "May aid weight maintenance", "Description": "Some studies suggest that adding omega-3 fats from salmon oil to your diet, along with other lifestyle modifications, may help you reach and maintain a healthy weight. Nevertheless, the data is mixed.\n\nSeveral animal studies have revealed that taking omega-3 supplements may reduce the tendency to accumulate excess body fat (15Trusted Source).\n\nA few human studies have also shown that taking omega-3 supplements had a similar effect, reducing body fat accumulation when the supplements were paired with a reduced-calorie diet and exercise plan (15Trusted Source).\n\nHowever, most of this evidence comes from very short-term studies (15Trusted Source).\n\nMore long-term research is needed to better assess the role of salmon oil on obesity and weight control in humans."}, {"Benefit": "Easy to add to your diet", "Description": "Incorporating salmon oil into your diet is easy. One simple option is to add salmon to your weekly meal plan.\n\nTo reap the greatest benefits, the American Heart Association recommends enjoying a 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of fatty fish like salmon at least two times per week (16Trusted Source).\n\nFresh, frozen, or canned salmon are all great options.\n\nFor an easy weeknight dinner, season a salmon fillet with garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil and roast it on a sheet pan with a variety of nutrient-dense vegetables.\n\nTry using canned salmon to make an herbed or curried salmon salad. Serve it as a sandwich or on a bed of leafy greens for a light and satisfying lunch."}]
